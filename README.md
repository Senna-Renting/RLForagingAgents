# RLForagingAgents
In this repository code will be put for my thesis. I will mainly be implementing a RL-algorithms JAX. Then I will test one of these models in a foraging environment. This environment will be a rectangular bound world with one (maybe two) patches that contain resources, which decay over time when being collected by the agents. The agents will then have to work together to optimize their own reward including the information (Q-value map) they receive from the other agents. The actual research will then be to check how communication will affect the Nash Social Welfare of the agents rewards (resources) collected over time.
