# RLForagingAgents
In this repository code will be put for my thesis. I will mainly be implementing a RL-algorithms JAX. Then I will test one of these models in a foraging environment. This environment will be a rectangular bound world with one patch that contains resources, which decay over time when being collected by the agents. The agents will then have to work together to optimize their own reward including the information (Q-value map) they receive from the other agents. I will research how communication will affect the agents' ability to collect resources over time.
